## The Draw
Based on March 2022 FIFA ranking, thirty-two qualified teams are placed in four pots and from each pot one team can be placed in each group. Host nation Qatar must be position one of the first group. The restriction rules that prevent teams from one continent to be placed in the same group should also be considered. In a rare event, three of the thirty-two teams were determined after the draw, further complicating the restriction rules. </br>
## Motivations
As a long time football fan and a beginner programmer, watching the draw for the World Cup group phase that took place in Doha, Qatar, on April 1 2022 gave me the thought that simulating the process would be a good idea to improve my programming knowledge.
